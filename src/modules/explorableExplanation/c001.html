  <p>
    Look at that, it's a room, and it's all pixely! How very 2001!
    It's built from individual tiles off a custom tileset.
    Presumably, it should function like a room, by which I mean it should trap the little dude
    within its constraints. Hey, at least he's got internet access.
  </p>

  <small>
    (show off how you built this room, because it's super impressive,
    then move the little dude around)
  </small>

  <p>
    So the walls restrict his movement, as does the furniture.
    You can't go through a table in real life, or at least <i>I</i> can't,
    so the constraints are working as intended.
  </p>

  <h2>So how are we achieveing this?</h2>

  <small>I mean "we" as in the royal "we".</small>

  <p>
    Besides the tiles that make up the room,
    there's also a set of invisible tiles that let the little dude know where he can't go.
  </p>

  <p>If you go upstairs, you'll get a better idea of what I'm talking about.</p>
